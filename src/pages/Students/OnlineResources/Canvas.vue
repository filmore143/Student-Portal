      Canvas is a learning management system (LMS) by Instructure. What is a LMS
      you ask?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) explains an LMS
      as a "software application that automates the administration, tracking,
      and reporting of [education] events. However, it’s not that simple. A
      robust LMS should be able to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>centralize and automate administration</li>
      <li>use self-service and self-guided services</li>
      <li>assemble and deliver learning content rapidly</li>
      <li>
        consolidate [education] initiatives on a scalable web-based platform
      </li>
      <li>support portability and standards</li>
      <li>personalize content and enable knowledge reuse</li>
      <li>

    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      In other words, it is software that allows you to store resources in an
      accessible way for your students and parents. In addition to being a
      resource repository, Canvas allows you to assess your students, provide
      collaborative experiences, and and provides data and feedback.

      But, wait there's more - You can do all of this from a iPad or smartphone!
      Your students can receive alerts that their paper is due or has been
      graded as a text or a Facebook message. Our job is to make learning
      engaging for your students and to enable teaching to be effective and
      powerful for you.
